My Example v.dat is this:

1.0.0
Blueberry.jpg,1.0.0
Readme.txt,1.0.3
Data/Somthing.dll,1.2.4

It basicly first, lists the program version
Then it lists the individual file info.

(This is uploaded to the webspace you put in modUpdate)
Server Side v.dat:
1.0.1
Blueberry.jpg,1.0.1
Readme.txt,1.0.3
Data/Somthing.dll,1.2.3
Data/More.dll,1.0.0

How it updates:
First it sees that 1.0.0 < 1.0.1 so update starts

First it checks Blueberry.jpg (1.0.0 < 1.0.1) So it updates it.
Then checks the Readme file, (1.0.3 = 1.0.3) So doesn't update it.
Checks Data/Somthing.dll (1.2.4 > 1.2.3) No update here.
Finnaly checks Data/More.dll (File doesnt exist) So downloads it then updates it.

What you need to put on your website:
v.dat
News.txt
(The files to be updated, Compressed using the Compression/Decompression Wizard.)

Blueberry.jpg
Readme.txt
Data/Somthing.dll
Data/More.dll
